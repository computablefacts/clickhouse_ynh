    <!-- Listen specified address.
         Use :: (wildcard IPv6 address), if you want to accept connections both with IPv4 and IPv6 from everywhere.
         Notes:
         If you open connections from wildcard address, make sure that at least one of the following measures applied:
         - server is protected by firewall and not accessible from untrusted networks;
         - all users are restricted to subset of network addresses (see users.xml);
         - all users have strong passwords, only secure (TLS) interfaces are accessible, or connections are only made via TLS interfaces.
         - users without password have readonly access.
